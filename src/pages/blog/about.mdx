Welcome to TheLoft!

We're a digital studio with one goal: to help grow the next generation of christian artists!

How do we do this?

Through software and of course, through prayer ;D

We have so far built [TheLoft Cafe](https://tlc.solomonlijo.com), a magical place where you can travel around the world from the comfort of your desk, exploring new cities by foot or by car, all while listening to chill christian music. Simply sit back, praise God, and relax!

We have a lot more to do and if you got any ideas that we could work on, don't hesitate to give us a DM [at] one of our [socials](https://linktr.ee/solomonlijo)
